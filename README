makeepub is a Python script that generates a epub file from a
description file passed through the command line and a bunch of
HTML files.
The script generates the boring part of the ePub metadata, e.g.
the index that appears both in contents.opf, toc.ncx, and also
in a HTML page.
All the metadata is given in a dictionary contained in Python
(NOTE: it's not safe, since the contents file is caused to be
interpreted in Python, and a malicious person could put an
import and tell the system to exec an "rm" command. In any case,
the book description file is very small and you can check it
before run. Later on I can change it to JSON. Later.)

For the script to generate the indexes (content.opf, toc.ncx,
and a HTML index, this last one may be hand made, if you want)
the HTML content must follow a couple of simple rules:

* Use header tags consistently: <h1> for section/chapter,
  <h2> for subsection, <h3> for subsubsection.
* Use the "id" attribute to identify the entry in the index.

I thought that true Latin would be nicer than lorem ipsum, so
I added a real Latin book as an example on how to use the script.
It is in the "didascalicon" directory.
